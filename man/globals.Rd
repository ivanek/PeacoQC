\title{Declare Global Variables for PeacoQC Analysis}
\description{
Suppresses R CMD check notes about undefined global variables used in 
non-standard evaluation contexts (typically in dplyr/ggplot operations).
These variables are related to cytometry data analysis in PeacoQC.
}
\details{
The following variables are declared as global to prevent R CMD check notes:
\itemize{
  \item Bin - Bin identifier for data binning operations
  \item Cells - Count or identifier of cells in cytometry data
  \item Cluster - Cluster identifier for grouped cells
  \item Peak - Peak identifier in density distributions
  \item fill_blocks - Variable for block filling in visualizations
  \item minimum - Minimum value in a given context
  \item x_max - Maximum value on x-axis
  \item x_min - Minimum value on x-axis
  \item y_max - Maximum value on y-axis
  \item y_min - Minimum value on y-axis
}
}
\note{
This is a development-time declaration and does not affect runtime behavior.
It is used to inform R CMD check that these variables are intentionally used
in non-standard evaluation contexts.
